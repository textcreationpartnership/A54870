            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt other diſadvantages, to which the poſthume publication of deceaſed mens works is ſubject, one is, that the publiſhers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuſpected to have dealt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly either with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours themſelves, in aſcribing that to them which is not theirs, or with others in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping that intereſt unto which they might pretend a better title.</p>
            <p>That no ſuch ſuſpition may take hold on me by occaſion of theſe enſuing Expoſitions, I preſume to preſent them unto you, who beſt know how I may be juſtified by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Authours own-hand written copies, and laſt will and teſtament.

But for the Method obſerved in the handling thereof (how meanly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſteemed of by many who peradventure never took the pains to look into it) I dare be bold to ſay, that no true Artiſt can upon ſerious conſideration except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but that he muſt ſecretly condemne himſelfe of too too wilfull prejudice and partiality.

<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23, 25. it is the word of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 17. and prayer obtains the ſpirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. which is the ſpirit of faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. therefore the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by prayer ſought faith of Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5.</p>

<hi>David</hi> here profeſſeth his heart was free from fear, and that hee was confident. And to clear the propoſition, it containeth two things. Firſt, that fear and confidence are contrary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: this is acknowledged by the very heathen, as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in naturall philoſophy, which none can deny, that know the nature of theſe affections,<note place="margin">What fear is.</note> or feel the force of them.

                        <note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note>HAving, in the former verſes, plainly expreſſed the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular benefits, he received by having the true God for his God: as namely, that he himſelf was encouraged in the greateſt aſſaults of his enemies. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1,
3. and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, his enemies were daunted and diſmayed,
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. Here in this verſe, he ſhews his ardent affection towards the place of Gods worſhip, being indeed the onely way for his ſoul to enjoy ſociety with God, who was his light, and ſalvation, and the ſtrength of his life.</p>
                     <p>This affection of <hi>David,</hi> towards the place of Gods worſhip, is here notably expreſſed, three ways. Firſt, by this, that he makes it the onely matter of his ſpeciall ſuit unto God; which both formerly he had deſired, and would yet alſo ſtill ſeek after: one thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord. Secondly, by the length of time, for which he would enjoy that benefit, namely, all the dayes of his life. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the comfortable ends, for which he deſires it, which here are theſe two: firſt, <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>to enquire in his temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt: the Lords houſe, in <hi>Davids</hi> time, was the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to which he had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the ordinances of divine ſervice; for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, his people did thither aſſemble themſelves, while it ſtood, and to the Temple built by
<hi>Solomon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whereto God made the promiſe of his preſence,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.3. whither the Tribes went up. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.4. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which place <hi>Davids</hi> heart was truly addicted: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.8.
<hi>Lord I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.3. <hi>I have ſet my affection to the houſe of my God.</hi> But now, in the new
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98878:17"/>teſtament, difference of place, in reſpect of holineſſe, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21. and Gods houſe is his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that is, ſuch companies, and aſſemblies of people, as be in covenant with God, and meet together in Chriſts name, to perform worſhip and ſervice unto God: as <hi>Mat.</hi>
18.20. For the godly are Gods temple, and Gods houſe. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Now to dwell in Gods houſe is, to continue a true member of Gods Church, a true believer, enjoying the liberty and comfort of Gods holy worſhip and ſervice: wherein, though the Prieſts and Levites had a ſpeciall priviledge, whoſe calling was to do ſervice in the ſanctuary, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.1. yet it was not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them alone, as appeares by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1. and laſt, compared with
<hi>Luke</hi> 2.36.37. where men, and women, that are truly godly, are ſaid to dwell in Gods houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note>Here then, in this firſt expreſſion of <hi>Davids</hi> affection, towards the houſe of God, note two things. Firſt, that <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſet upon the houſe of God above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: he was more in prayer, and endeavour after this bleſſing, to dwell in Gods houſe, then after any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing. This he often teſtifieth, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. <hi>I have ſet mine affection to the houſe of my God.</hi> Pſal. 26.8.
<hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thine houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> Pſal. 122.1. <hi>I was glad, when they ſaid unto me, let us go to the houſe of the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1,
2, 10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2, 4.</p>
                     <p>This affection is the more to be marked in <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the world wonders at it in Gods children: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8, 9. and derides them for it, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the reaſons, that moved him thereunto: which are indeed the wonderfull, rare, heavenly bleſſings, which are certainly enjoyed in Gods houſe,<note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon.</note> and no where elſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt and principall (from which all the reſt do flow) is the ſure fruition of ſociety and fellowſhip with the true God; who is one in eſſence, three in perſons, the father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Who, though the whole world be his, yet onely ſhewes his ſpeciall grace and favour, to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98878:17"/>true members of his Church: as
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 28. <hi>Hee ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgements unto Iſrael: He hath not dealt ſo with any nation, &amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me, above all people.</hi> And therefore they, that are out of the Church, are ſaid to be without Chriſt, and without God in the world.
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. and cannot receive the holy Ghoſt, who is the true ſanctifier and comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church is.</note>Behold then the priviledge of the Church, and of the true members thereof: the true God, who is one in eſſence, three in perſons, as God, is their Lord and King, which is a great ground of their true happineſſe. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> accounted <hi>Solomons</hi> ſervants happy, in having a King ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for wiſedome, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. <hi>But behold, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Solomon is here,</hi> Matth. 12.42. a King and Maſter in his Church, who can give deliverance by command, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.4. and will honour all his faithfull ſervants. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>Where I am, there alſo ſhall my ſervant be. If any man ſerve me, him will my father honour:</hi> ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37, 43, 44. More particularly, God the father is in Chriſt their father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>John</hi> 20.17. even the father of mercies: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. who will take notice of the wants of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and make ſupply upon their ſober, and ſanctified uſe of lawfull means, if firſt and chiefly they ſeek heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32, 33. and what is wanting in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtate, he will fully make out in their eternall. <hi>Luke</hi>
12.32. Alſo God the ſonne is, in and to his Church, a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſaviour and redeemer: he is the head unto his Church, which is his body.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. and the ſaviour of his body. <hi>Eph,</hi> 5.23. See
<hi>Luke.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6.8. Yea he is an husband unto their ſouls. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Thy maker is thine husband.</hi> Iſa. 62.4, 5. <hi>Thy land ſhall be married. As a young man marrieth a virgin — and as the bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth over the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee.</hi> And God the holy Ghoſt is, to his Church, a bleſſed ſanctifier and comforter, the ſpirit of grace and ſupplications. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>And becauſe ye are ſonnes. God hath ſent forth the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98878:18"/>ſpirit of his ſonne into your hearts.</hi> Gal. 4.6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the true God, in Chriſt Jeſus, gives to all the true members of the Church freedome, and deliverance from all hurtfull evils. By imputing his righteouſneſſe unto them, he doth acquit them from the whole guilt, and curſe of ſinne, both originall corruptions, and actuall tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: whereupon all the evils thereof, in temporall and corporall miſeries, as they are curſes, are removed. See <hi>Gal.</hi>
3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us:</hi> whereupon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jeſus:</hi> and more generally, <hi>Luke</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The uſe for inſtruction.</note>For inſtruction: ſee a reaſon of the different affections, to be ſeen in men toward the houſe of God; and the ſacred ordinances therein uſed: ſome are exceeding zealous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. longing and fainting for the Courts of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi>

The way is to get the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12. for which end, wee muſt uſe Gods meanes, the word preached: <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. and prayer,

<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. Secondly, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting after grace, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.3. Thirdly, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in new obedience,

The way is: Firſt, to watch againſt temptation to ſinne, which is a cloud, to hide Gods face from his people: as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44.
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.2. Secondly, to bee frequent and diligent in thoſe ſacred ordinances, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſervices, wherein God begets, and encreaſeth grace in their hearts: which now are, the ſolemn parts of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall miniſtery, in the word preached; ſacraments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently adminiſtred; and prayer with thankeſgiving.

23. <hi>He that hath my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is, that loveth me: and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my father: and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him.

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond end, for which <hi>Davids</hi> deſires to dwell in Gods houſe, is, that he may enquire in his temple, that is, diligently ſeek direction of God, in all caſes of doubt,<note place="margin">

<hi>David</hi> aſſures himſelf, that being a true member of Gods Church, his grace and favour, power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould be, as the Lords pavilion, and as the ſecret place of his tabernacle; even a ſure and ſafe place of ſafety, and ſecurity to him.

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.1. <hi>O Lord my God, in thee do I put my truſt: ſave me from all them, that perſecute me, and deliver me.</hi> Pſal. 116.3, 4.
<hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the paines of

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he made conſcience of a godly and upright life, and thereon grounds his aſſurance of ſpeciall protection: Pſal 4.3.
<hi>Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for himſelf: the Lord will hear, when I call upon him.</hi> Pſal. 18.17, 20. <hi>He delivered me from my ſtrong enemy — The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſſe, &amp;c,</hi> Verſ. 21, 22, 23. <hi>For I have kept the wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were before me: and I did not put away his ſtatutes from me. I was alſo upright before him: and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 41.2. <hi>Thou upholdeſt me in mine integrity, and ſetteſt me before thy face for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſerves for inſtruction, and for admonition, and for comfort.</p>

                     <p>But is this common to all, as they are men, or is there ſome ſpeciall work of God required in them, and among them, that be his houſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. John</hi> 6.44. No man can come to me, except the father, which hath ſent me, draw him, that is, give him grace ſo to do from above. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 65. It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. Thoſe, that believe on his name, are born not of bloud, nor of the wil of the fleſh, nor of the wil of man, but of God. <hi>John</hi> 1.13. For it is God, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98878:28"/>worketh in you both to will, and to do, of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                     <p>But what hath man then to do, ſith our converſion and regeneration is Gods work?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is indeed Gods work, yet in the uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes, which he gives to reaſonable creatures, that therein they may wait for, and receive Gods work of grace, in an holy calling: which, both amongſt Jewes and Gentiles, doth diſtinguiſh the elect from the reprobate: as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. Now this calling is in the Goſpel preached, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by prayer, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 13.14. and therein are men made Gods houſe: <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>But may every man in the uſe of the Goſpel preached, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this calling?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For ought that either Miniſter or people do know to the contrary, every one may be called that lives under the Goſpel; the fault is their own if they be not: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. For men undoubtedly do firſt rebell againſt the word, and refuſe Gods mercy offered in the meanes of grace, before that God with-draw his grace, or take away from them the uſe of the means. In regard whereof, Chriſt complains of the Jews, that, when he would have gathered them, they would not. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. For, though the beſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of nature, be inſufficient to get the true habit of grace, without the work of the ſpirit; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. yet ſure it is, men are firſt wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the uſe of means, before the bleſſing of the ſpirit be denied unto them. Their own hearts can tell them, they have failed in turning from ſinne, as
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after grace, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.3. and in doing the good they know, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note>IN the beginning of this Verſe, the Prophet addes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, of his earneſt deſire to dwell in Gods houſe, expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. drawn from the benefit of honour and dignity, whereto God would now ſhortly advance him, and lift up his head, above his enemies round about him: whereupon he ſolemnly profeſſeth, that he would glorifie God, with the ſacrifices of joy, and ſing praiſes unto God. Here then we have two things to handle: Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> prediction of his dignity and honour: ſecondly, his ſolemn profeſſion of his thankfull behaviour. The prediction of his honour is, in the firſt part of the verſe, ſet out metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and comparatively, and amplified by the circumſtance of time, when it ſhall be. Metaphorically thus, <hi>my head ſhall be lifted up:</hi> that is, I ſhall be advanced in dignity and honour, and ſo to cheerfull and comfortable eſtate: for men dejected and humbled hang down the head, when therefore they are advanced and cheered, then are they ſaid to have their head lifted up: as
<hi>Gen.</hi> 40.17. <hi>Pharaoh ſhall lift up thine head, and reſtore thee to thy place. Jer.</hi> 52.31, 32. <hi>Evilmerodach the King of Babylon lifted up the head of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakin King of Judah, and brought him forth out of priſon, and kindly ſpake unto him, and ſet his throne above the throne the Kings, that were with him in Babylon.</hi> Comparatively, he ſaith, <hi>his head ſhall bee lifted up above his enemies round about him.</hi> And the time when it ſhall be is now, the time preſent, which makes it the more comfortable. As if hee ſhould have ſaid, though I have been long and much deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yet now ſhall I be advanced and cheered, above mine enemies round about me.</p>

                     <p>HEre <hi>David</hi> goes on in the matter of prayer, begun in the former verſe;<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> and firſt doth teſtifie the truth and redineſſe of his heart, to anſwer and obey Gods command, for the ſeeking of his face, verſe 8. which being chiefly done in the duty and exerciſe of prayer, he doth verſe 9. put up humble and earneſt ſuit unto God, for favour and mercy in ſundry petitions; and to move the Lord to grant them, he makes mention of Gods former favour in this kind, ſaying, <hi>thou haſt been my help, and ſhuts up theſe requeſts,</hi> with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table teſtimony of true affiance in God, calling him the God of his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Here then, in theſe two verſes, we have in generall three things to handle: Firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> ſincerity, in readineſſe to anſwer Gods command unto his people, that they ſhould ſeek his face, verſe 8. Secondly, <hi>Davids</hi> humble and earneſt requeſts, for favour and mercy, anſwerable to his former profeſſion. Thirdly,
<hi>Davids</hi> motives propounded to God, to move him to grant his requeſts verſe 9.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt: <hi>Davids</hi> ſincerity, and readineſſe to anſwer Gods command, for the ſeeking of his face, is this: when thou ſaiſt, <hi>ſeek ye my face, my heart ſaid unto thee, thy face
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98878:36"/>O Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> For the right underſtanding whereof we muſt know, that the ſpeech, of ſentence in the originall to make it plain, requires the ſupply of ſome words, which are fitly added in our bibles: when thou ſaideſt: as the like is elſewhere, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 20.34. And I (ſaid <hi>Ahab</hi>) will ſend thee away with this covenant.</p>
                     <p>This defect of a word, to be ſupplied for plainneſſe ſake, hath cauſed great variety amongſt tranſlatours. The moſt ancient of them, as the <hi>Septuagint, Aquila, Simmachus,</hi> the vulgar latine, and <hi>Jerom</hi> (whom moſt of the Popiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors, and the Doway bible doe follow) tranſlate the words to this effect: <hi>My face hath ſought out, or ſought thee out,</hi> making the word face the nominative caſe to the verb ſought, whereas our tranſlations make the word face the accuſative caſe following the verbe ſeek: and, though the words in the originall will beare either of the former, yet ſeeing both were not intended by the holy ghoſt, for this reaſon do I prefer our own tranſlations before the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, becauſe in the bible, the words in the orginall are ordinarily tranſlated by the foreſaid ancients, as ours have done; as 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. and not once, I take it, in all the bible, can their tranſlation be warranted, by ſhewing the like diſpoſing of the words, where face is the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſe to the verb ſeek.</p>
                     <p>Now then, taking the words in that ſenſe, which our tranſlation gives, we have two things to note in them: firſt, Gods commandement unto his people for the ſeeking of his face: Secondly,
<hi>Davids</hi> readineſſe to yeeld obedience thereto. For the firſt, the words tranſlated, <hi>ſeek ye my face,</hi> are in the originall, not a queſtion, but a command; for the verb is of the imparative mood, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before my face, that is, before me: but Gods grace and favour in his Sanctuary, where God did manifeſt his preſence, between the Cherubims, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the mercy ſeat, there communing with the high prieſt,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98878:36"/>of all things given in charge concerning the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Exod.</hi> 25.22. towards which the people were to look, when they ſought Gods grace and favour: Mark then,<note place="margin">The firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note> God enjoyned his people the Jewes to ſeek his face, that is, his grace and favour in the ſanctuary, looking toward the mercy ſeat, which is ſometime called the face of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a teſtimony of his preſence among his people,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.4. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, and his ſtrength</hi> (that is the ark of the covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.8.) ſeek his face continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (that is, the mercy ſeat, a bleſſed teſtimony of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous favour, and preſence amongſt his people), ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14.</p>

                     <p>The reaſons propounded by <hi>David,</hi> to move God to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98878:42"/>vouchſafe his favour, and not hide his face, &amp;c. are three? The firſt is implied in the title ſervant, wherewith <hi>David</hi> ſtiles himſelf in the ſecond branch of this petition: put not thy ſervant away in anger. Where, in <hi>Davids</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this is plain,<note place="margin">The ſecond Obſervation.</note> That to be Gods ſervant, is a good ground, and ſtep towards the attainment of Gods favour: it is that which gives title to mercy, in time of trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.15, 16. <hi>Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies — make thy face to ſhine upon thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſave me for thy mercies ſake.</hi> Pſal. 69.17. <hi>Hide not thy face from thy ſervant, for I am in trouble.</hi> Pſal. 86.4. <hi>Rejoyce the ſoul of thy ſervant.</hi> Iſa. 65.13, 14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God.

                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>The reaſon is plain: Every true ſervant of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in covenant with God, by an holy calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. He that is called in the Lord, being a ſervant, is the Lords free-man: likewiſe alſo he, that is called being free, is Chriſts ſervant: ſo that whether he be bond or free, by his holy calling he belongs to God.

                        <note place="margin">The firſt Uſe for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note>For inſtruction, two wayes. Firſt, that it is a bleſſed, and happy thing, to be Gods true ſervant. Conſider what the Queen of Sheba ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſervants, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8.
<hi>Happy are theſe thy ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. Now Chriſt Jeſus is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Solomon. Matth.</hi> 12.42. and ſo a better Maſter.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98878:42"/>Good earthly Maſters, will honour good ſervants: as <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.18. <hi>He that waiteth on his Maſter ſhall bee honoured.</hi> Prov. 17.2. <hi>A wiſe ſervant ſhall have a portion, or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, among the brethren.</hi> But how ever ſome earthly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be <hi>Nabals,</hi> and <hi>Labans,</hi> yet God will not be ſo. <hi>John</hi> 12, 26 <hi>Where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſervant be.

21.15. which, to bee the common thought of moſt men, their behaviour doth plainly bewray: for mark their cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for diligence in Gods ſervice on the Lords day, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the pains, and pleaſure alſo, they take about world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comodities in the week day: their behaviour ſaith aloud, that their heart thinks Gods ſervice is a vain thing, elſe they would take more pains and pleaſure therein: undoubtedly they do not conceive of, nor believe the teſtimony of God, touching the proſperity of his ſervants: for God taketh pleaſure therein, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35.27. elſe he would never undertake for their direction, in the way they ought to walk, for their proviſion, for all needfull bleſſings, for their protection, from all hurtfull evils, and for their remuneration, both here and for ever, as the Scripture ſaith he doth.</p>

<hi>Saul</hi> did. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.5, 6. Firſt, deſire to know Chriſt, then ſubject themſelves to his holy will, and wait in prayer for grace and mercy. See <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9, 11.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Uſe for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</note>Secondly, Gods children, that have entred covenant with God, muſt be carefull to ſhew themſelves Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: for profeſſion without practice is nothing but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, making us like the Church of Sardis, who had a name to be alive,<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of good ſervants.</note> but was dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. Therefore wee muſt get the certain and infallible properties of good ſervants, which are partly inward, and partly outward. The inward are good affections, which are ſpecially three. Firſt, fear and reverence, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. Secordly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable obedience to his revealed will. Reaſon from <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7. and from the Centurions confeſſion <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.9. as from the leſſe to the greater. Without this, none are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. This muſt be ſeen, both in eſchewing evill, and doing good: as God ſaith of his ſervant <hi>Job, Job.</hi> 1.8, 9. yea, we muſt ſhew our well-doing, in improving our Maſters talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.23, 25. in fighting for him and for the faith, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. in waiting for his coming, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.36. And in all theſe, we muſt be ſervants in ordinary, not onely retainers that ſerve God by fits. Thirdly, wee muſt patiently ſuffer his corrections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9, 10. Reaſon from 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, &amp;c. as from the leſſe to the greater. Fourthly, we muſt praiſe God for his mercy, Pſal. 134.1. Pſal. 50.23. Pſal.
119.175.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon, which <hi>David</hi> uſeth to move the Lord not to hide his face, &amp;c. is plainly expreſſed, drawne from his own experience of Gods former mercies, in times of trouble, ſaying:
<hi>Thou haſt been my help,</hi> that is, when as heretofore I have been in diſtreſſe and danger, thou haſt holpen me, and therein ſhewed thy favour toward mee. Now hereupon, ſaith <hi>David:</hi> knowing thee to be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I appeal unto thee, for like mercy, that I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:98878:43"/>
                     <p>In this reaſon we have two things to note. Firſt, the thing confeſſed by <hi>David,</hi> ſimply conſidered by it ſelf: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with reference to the end, for which <hi>David</hi> here propounds it. For the firſt, the thing confeſſed by <hi>David,</hi> ſimply conſidered, is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The third obſervation.</note>That God was <hi>Davids</hi> helper, and ſo had been, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54.4.
<hi>Behold, God is mine helper.</hi> Pſal. 3.3. <hi>Thou Lord art a ſhield for me: my glory, and the lifter up of my head:</hi> Pſal. 30.10. <hi>Hear Lord, and have mercy upon me, Lord be thou mine helper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon.</note>The reaſon hereof is threefold. Firſt, Gods free grace and mercy, receiving
<hi>David</hi> into covenant, and therein undertaking to become his helper and deliverer. Pſal. 89.3.21, 22. <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen, I have ſworn unto</hi> David <hi>my ſervant—with whom my hand ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed — the enemy ſhall not exact upon him, &amp;c.</hi> And this is anſwerable to that, which God ſaith to his people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Pſal. 50.5.15.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Reaſon.</note>Secondly,
<hi>David</hi> put his truſt in God, whereby he was intituled to Gods help in trouble. Pſal. 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, and my ſhield, mine heart truſted in him, and I am helped:</hi> for indeed to ſuch God becomes an helper. Pſal. 37.39, 40. Pſal. 33.18, 19.</p>

<hi>David</hi> walked before God in conſcionable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which gave him title to this bleſſing, <hi>to have the Lord to be his helper.</hi> Pſal.

                     <p>This ſerves for inſtruction, and for admonition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The uſe for inſtruction.</note>For inſtruction, in that, which <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, we may ſee a notable priviledge of the godly, who be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, do love and fear God, and truſt in him,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98878:44"/>and teſtifie the ſame by conſcionable obedience, theſe have this prerogative, that the true God, is their helper: which, to be a great bleſſing, is plainly affirmed, with very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant illuſtration. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3, 4, 5. for Princes are potent earthly helpers, but vain is their help without the Lord: for their breath is in their noſtrils, but the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is the living God, who doth neither ſlumber nor ſleep, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 121.1, 2, 3,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo is the beſt helper, as we may ſee at large,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. thoroughout, eſpecially, verſ. 9.14, 15. whence he is by way of excellence, ſtiled the deliverer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. becauſe, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaid, none can deliver as hee doth, <hi>Dan.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The firſt uſe for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note>For admonition, it ſerves two wayes. Firſt, to labour diligently, to get into our ſelves the grounds of this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in having the true God for our helper, as <hi>David</hi> had. The way hereto we may ſee in <hi>David:</hi> Firſt, get tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly into covenant with God, and reſt not in the outward title of profeſſion, having onely the outward ſeals thereof: for ſo far went the fooliſh Virgins,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.2, 3. and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> but as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. their outward circumciſion did not make them ſuch, no more doth our outward baptiſme, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Therefore we muſt get the ingrafting grace of true faith, which purifies the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7. wherein ſtands true inward baptiſme: for where God eſtabliſheth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, he writes the law in the inward parts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 12. Then profeſſing this eſtate, of being in covenant with God, get the inward ſaving graces of love and fear, and from them bring forth the fruits of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as
<hi>David</hi> did, and the prerogative of having God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98878:44"/>for our helper, ſhall be aſſured unto us, for he hath ſaid, <hi>I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Heb. 13.5.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Uſe for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</note>Secondly, to watch carefully and conſtantly againſt that thing, which will deprive us of this priviledge, and that is ſinne: for it is a work of darkneſſe, wherewith God will have no ſociety. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
94.20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. It ſeparates between God and us. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
59.2. Whereupon the Lord ſaid to his own people the Jews, he would deliver them no more out of the hands of their enemies. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.13, 14. Therefore with <hi>David,</hi> we muſt hide Gods ſayings in our hearts, that we may not ſinne againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. and ſo ſtrive to keep our ſelves from our iniquity. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18.23.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, conſider this prerogative profeſſed by
<hi>David,</hi> in having God for his helper, with reference to the end, for which he doth here mention it, which is, to move the Lord not to hide his face from him, &amp;c. becauſe formerly he hath ſhewed himſelf gracious and favourable towards him: and therein this is plain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The fourth Obſervation.</note>That
<hi>David</hi> makes his own experience of Gods help, in former evils, a ground of prayer, for preſent favour, in his renewed troubles. When <hi>David</hi> was in the wilderneſſe of Judah, flying from <hi>Sauls</hi> perſecution,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. the title; in the 7. verſe he pleadeth thus for mercy;
<hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my help, therefore under the ſhadow of thy wings will I rejoyce.</hi> Pſal. 77.2, 5. <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord</hi> — <hi>I conſidered the dayes of old.</hi> Pſal
89.49. <hi>Lord where are thy former loving kindneſſes.</hi> Pſal. 71.4,
5, 6. <hi>Deliver me, O Lord, out of the hand of the wicked</hi> —
<hi>for thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou art my truſt, even from my youth: by thee I have beene holden up from the womb.</hi> Verſ. 17, 18. <hi>O God, thou haſt taught mee from my youth. Now alſo, when I am old, and gray-headed, O God, forſake me not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is plain: <hi>David</hi> knew, the true God was unchangeable, and immutable,<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note> not onely in his eſſence, but alſo in his love, favour, and mercy towards his elect, who are his redeemed, in and by Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98878:45"/>with whom his covenant of grace is everlaſting, ſo as he will never turn away from them to do them good.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. Whereupon he ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, and I change not, and ye ſonnes of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not confounded.</hi> Mal. 3.6. For as much as he loved his own which were in the world, to the end he loved them.
<hi>John</hi> 13.1. For though he repent of temporall gifts and bleſſings, as of making of <hi>Saul</hi> King; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. yet his gifts and calling (which concerne ſalvation in Chriſt) are without repentance. Now
<hi>Davids</hi> holy calling, entituling him to this covenant, hee might plead, for the renewing of Gods favour in preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, upon the ſenſe and feeling thereof in former times.</p>
                     <p>This ſerves for inſtruction, and for admonition.</p>
                     <p>

<hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. If any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe true religion, and give good hopes for a time, do fall away, they ſhew by their apoſtaſte, that they began in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, or at the beſt, were but like the ſtony ground, who believed for a time, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. having onely an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But the godly may commit mortall ſins, as
<hi>David</hi> did, in adultery and murther: now an adulterer is the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of an harlot, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. and a murtherer is the childe of the devill,
<hi>John</hi> 8.44. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12. was he not then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from grace?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be denied, but for theſe heinous ſins, <hi>David</hi> was juſtly under the wrath of God, till by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of his repentance, and faith in the Meſſiah, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained attonement. But yet, under the guilt of theſe ſins, he differed much from the impenitent and unregenerate, not onely in regard of Gods certain purpoſe to renew him by repentance, and reſtore him into favour but even in preſent ſtate of ſoul, two wayes: Firſt, that the ſeed of grace did then remain, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that he ſinned not with full conſent,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, 19, 20. and ſo could not be ſo totally under the curſe, as the unregenerate are. For the better conceiving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we muſt know, that every regenerate man, whileſt he is in this world, hath in him both fleſh and ſpirit, in-bred corruption, and renewed grace, and ſo conſiſteth (as it were) of a double perſon, the old man, which is corrupt through deceivable luſts, and the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 24. Now when the childe of God committeth ſin, even grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinnes, as <hi>David</hi> did, to ſpeak as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of himſelf,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98878:50"/>it is not he that doth it, ſo farre forth as he is regenerate, but he, ſo farre forth as he is corrupt, which
<hi>Paul</hi> calleth ſin that dwelleth in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. His ſervice of ſinne is with and from the fleſh, but in his minde renewed, he ſerves the law of Chriſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. which ſhewes, that grace in the habit, and ſeed, and root doth then remain, when and while corruption, in ſundry particular actions, doth prevail. Which to be true, is plain alſo by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied his Maſter with curſing and ſwearing (which in it ſelf was a fearfull mortall ſin) <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.72, 74. even after that comfortable ſpeech of Chriſt unto him; <hi>Simon, behold. Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you, as wheat, But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Luke 22.31, 32. Shall we ſay he now, by denying his Maſter loſt all grace; when as Chriſt had prayed for the continuance of his faith? nay rather acknowledge, that this failing was in this particular act, not in the habit and ſeed of grace.</p>

<hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly follow, ſpeaking of the corruption

The ſoule we know gives life to the body, and ſets every part a work about thoſe things it liketh: ſo as we may ſoundly argue, that he is endued with a reaſonable ſoule, who doth, conſtantly mannage his humane affayres with good diſcretion. In like
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98878:59"/>manner doth inbred corruption quicken ſinfull motions in the ſoule, and gaining conſent of will, draweth the parts of the body to become the tooles of the mind, for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinfull actions. Look therefore, where we ſee a courſe held in the practiſe of ſinne, there we may be ſure, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption bears dominion: when the motions of ſinne hath force in their members, to bring forth fruit unto death, then men are in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5.

                     <p>This raigning corruption, ſhewes it ſelf in man, when his mind is ſet in evill works, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.21. and he minds the things of the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. when his heart is fully ſet in him to do evill. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. when his tongue proclaimes his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for ſinne, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. <hi>we will certainly doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thing goeth out of our own mouth,</hi> Pſal. 12.4. <hi>with our tongue we will prevaile: our lips are our own, who is Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us?</hi> If. 56.12.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98878:60"/>brought forth in life: when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſinne: Mans ſinne is the child born, there ſpoken of; mans ſoule, as it is carnall, is the wombe, wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: the Suggeſtion of Satan, with mans own evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, are the ſeed whereof it is formed, and ſo farre forth is mans ſinne begotten of the devill, and hath him for the father; as he is called the father of lyes, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. for he put it into <hi>Judas</hi> heart to betray his maſter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.2. &amp; filled <hi>Ananias</hi> his heart, that he lyed unto God, <hi>Asts</hi> 5.3. and ſo became in them the father of thoſe grievous ſinnes, treachery in <hi>Judas,</hi> and hypocriſie in

<hi>The tranſgreſſion of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith within my heart, there is no feare of God before his eyes.</hi> This is likewiſe evident by the contrary affections in the godly, in whom grace is renewed: to get grace, and to practiſe obedience is their ſoule: as Chriſt told his diſciples,
<hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me,</hi> John 4.34. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water brooke, ſo panteth my ſoule after thee O God.

Let all Symoniſts in the Church, and bribers in the Common wealth. look towards their ghoſtly father: for like will to like, the briber to the devill. Now when, by theſe ſmuts of ſinne, they diſcern the black mine of corruption, then (unleſſe they will be as the fuell of hell fire) they muſt ſet themſelves to ſeeke a change of eſtate. This fleſh and blood cannot effect: for the way of man is not in himſelf, <hi>Jer,</hi> 10.23. man, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to do evill, can no more do good, then the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can change her skin, or the Leopard her ſpots, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23.

                     <p>Now this holy calling is wrought by God, in the uſe of means ordinarily, even in the word preached; the law to diſcover ſinne,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and the goſpell to ſow the ſeeds of grace,

This habitable place of the earth, wherein men live a naturall life, is the land of the living, in the ſtile and and phraſe of the holy Ghoſt. This is plain, and certain by the ordinary uſe of this phraſe in Scripture. See <hi>Job</hi> 28.12. The place of wiſedome is not found in the land of the living, that is, among living men in this world: for it were abſurd to ſay, the place of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were not to be found in heaven, ſeeing it is there ſaid, God underſtandeth the way thereof,

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond Obſervation.</note>The ſecond point to be here obſerved is this, That in the land of the living, that is in this world, God doth bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully impart his goodneſſe to the ſonnes of men: this is here taken for granted, and elſe-where plainly affirmed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. <hi>The earth is full of the goodneſſe of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.64. <hi>The earth is full of thy mercy,</hi> Pſal.
145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all: even the brute creatures do daily taſt of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Pſal. 104.27.28. <hi>They all wait upon him, he gives them their meat in due ſeaſon.

                        <note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon.</note>The reaſon hereof is two-fold.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98878:69"/>we muſt look, that we go not on in a courſe of ſinne, for that withholds good things, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. and cauſeth God not to hear our prayers, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 66.18.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond uſe for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note>Secondly, this muſt move us to labour to be ſuch, as ſhall ſurely partake of Gods beſt bleſſings: For God is the great houſekeeper, that makes proviſion for children, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yea for bruit creatures, even for his very dogs. And anſwerable to his greatneſſe in proviſion, is his juſtice, and wiſedome in diſtribution: he gives not to all alike, but to every one his portion, and will not have childrens bread gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to dogs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.26. Indeed for temporall bleſſings he many times gives a larger portion to the wicked, then to his children, as wee may ſee by the outward ſtate of <hi>Divet</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 10.19, 20. as great houſekeepers will many times feaſt ſtrangers more liberally, then their owne children. Yet God hath better things for his own, then for the world, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11, 16. And the right way to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the beſt bleſſings is,<note place="margin">The right way to partake of the beſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> firſt in generall to make ſure we be in covenant wich God through faith in Chriſt Jeſus: for he that cometh unto God muſt believe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, <hi>for he is the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh to the Father but by him,</hi> John 14.6.

<hi>whether things preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or things to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3.21, 22. we partake hereby of his fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. and God will prevent us with bleſſings of goodneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.5. In particular, to teſtifie the truth of our faith, we muſt get and manifeſt the grace of love: for this is a ſure companion of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and a ſure fruit of the ſame ſanctifying ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. and this entitles us unto Gods beſt bleſſings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>What eye hath not ſeen, eare hath not heard, nor heart concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hath God prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 John. 3.14. <hi>We know we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the bretheren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt fear God with a filiall feare: by the conſideration of Gods power and preſence, ſeeking to bring our hearts to true conſcience of eſchewing evill, and doing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98878:70"/>good, wherein his grace is certainly made evident, as <hi>Job</hi> 1.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.2. Thus ſhall we be ſurely entitled to Gods bleſſings; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12, 13, 14.

<hi>Sampſon,</hi> of <hi>Jephta,</hi> of <hi>Samuel, David,</hi> and the prophets: who through faith ſubdued Kingdomes, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32,
33, 34. So as we may well ſay of faith, what the Apoſtle doth of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. that it is profitable for all things, and hath the promiſe of all kind of bleſſings: for true faith is the prime grace of godlineſſe, to the ſure entitling of us to the beſt bleſſings; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                     <p>Here indeed every Chriſtian muſt wiſely and rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the different nature of bleſſings promiſed, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords meaning, intitle themſelves thereunto. For ſome promiſes concern bleſſings, ſimply neceſſary to true happineſſe, as be juſtification and ſanctification: other promiſes are made of bleſſings, both ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which are very good and comfortable, but not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation, as be peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy ghoſt, and all degrees of ſpirituall graces, above
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98878:71"/>that which ſhewes the truth and life thereof, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of knowledge, ſtrong faith, fervent love, and the like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which high degrees of grace ſome have had, as <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20. the Centurion,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7.9. and the woman of <hi>Canaan. Mat.</hi> 15.28. whereas the diſciples themſelves were, for a good while, men of little faith.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.30. and 16.8. and the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> had a little ſtrength, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                     <p>Now the promiſes of bleſſings, ſimply neceſſary to true happineſſe, are made abſolutely in Chriſt to true believers, without any other condition, as <hi>Acts</hi> 16, 31. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. but the promiſes of bleſſings, not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt be underſtood to be made with the exception of the croſſe, which is this. That God, out of his ſoveraignty over his deareſt children, may deny the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes, either for correction, or prevention of ſin, or tryall of grace, which well conſidered prevents much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and diſtreſſe in ſoule, to thoſe, that labour to walk honeſtly, and yet are more under the croſſe, then ſome of Gods children be, with whom they live.</p>
                     <p>For admonition,<note place="margin">The Uſe for admonition.</note> this ſerves notably to ſtirre up every one to get true faith: for every one deſires to enjoy Gods goodneſſe, many ſay, <hi>who will ſhew us any good? Pſal.</hi> 4.6. Now the way is to get faith, which entitles us to all Gods promiſe: and the right courſe herein is, to begin with the main promiſe in Chriſt, to get that faith in him, which may intitle us to his righteouſneſſe: for in him we are reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſanctified right in the creature, and in him all things are ours, things preſent, and things to come. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>All the promiſes of God are in him, yea and in him amen.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Therefore Chriſt himſelf bids his Diſciples, <hi>Firſt ſeek the King dome of God and his righteouſneſſe; and then all theſe things, pertaining to food and rayment, ſhall be miniſtred unto us, Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>For if God ſpared not his own ſome, but gave him for us, how ſhall he not with him give us all things alſo?</hi> Rom. 8.32. Now this true faith, is never ſevered from true repentance, not new obedience: <hi>for by ſight and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98878:72"/>for ſinne the way is prepared for Chriſt and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Mal. 3.1. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. And new obedience in eſchewing evill, and doing good, is that behaviour which comes from love, a fruit of the ſpirit, by which faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6,
22.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt point to be here obſerved is,<note place="margin">The fourth Obſervation.</note> the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which <hi>David</hi> received, by believing Gods word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, hereby he was preſerved from fainting in himſelf, and from being foyled by his enemies, in their moſt violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: for one or both of theſe evills he confeſſeth would have befallen him, if he had not believed: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.3, 6.
<hi>Thou Lord art a buckler for me,</hi> there is his ſaith, <hi>I will not be affraid of ten thouſand of the people, that have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt mee round about:</hi> there is his ſecurity from faith,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1, 3. <hi>My ſoule truſteth in thee: yea in the ſhaddow of thy wings will I make my refuge, till theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be overpaſt — He ſhall ſend from heaven and ſave me, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is plain:<note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note> for his faith intitled him to Gods power and providence, for protection and ſafety in time of danger, from whence ſprang that courage, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him from fainting in the depth of diſtreſſe: whereas, if he had wanted faith, he had indeed been out of covenant with God, and ſo void of title to Gods power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſo muſt needs have fainted, when worldly power and refuge had wholy failed him. This <hi>Davids</hi> enemies knew well, and therefore, thinking that God had forſaken him, they do thereupon encourage themſelves to perſecute him, with aſſurance to take him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.11.</p>
                     <p>This ſerves for inſtruction,<note place="margin">The firſt Uſe for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and for admonition.</p>
                     <p>For inſtruction two wayes. Firſt, it lets us plainly ſee the great evill of unbelief, for it takes away heart and courage in time of perſecution. This we may ſeeby <hi>Nabal,</hi> whoſe heart dyed within him, when he heard of deadly danger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37. and in <hi>Saul,</hi> when the Philiſtines came upon him, he was ſore troubled at the ſight of that huge Army. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.5. and afterwards fainted, when
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98878:72"/>he heard, by the witch of
<hi>Endors</hi> means, the heavy tydings of his approaching ruine,
<hi>verſe</hi> 20. and the day following deſperately fell upon his own ſword, when the Philiſtines preſſed near unto him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
31.4. Hence <hi>Ahaz</hi> and his peoples hearts were ſhaken as a leaf, when they heard, that <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> were conſpired againſt him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 7.2. at which time the Lord promiſed him mercy: but withall tells him of the hurt of unbelief. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>If yee will not believe, yee ſhall not be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, here again ſee the great benefit of faith,<note place="margin">The ſecond Uſe for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> both for courage and comfort in time of danger, <hi>for the righteous is bold as a Lyon. Prov.</hi>
28.1. <hi>when the wicked flye, and no man purſueth:</hi> and alſo for ſafety and deliverance, while it is a bleſſing to them. See
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 31.19, 20. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.1, 2, 9.</p>
                     <p>For admonition,<note place="margin">The Uſe for admonition.</note> it ſerves notably to move every one to get the grace of true faith, and to ſet the ſame a working in the time of danger. This world is full of evills and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as the Sea is of ſtormes and waves: now faith is as the ſterne that guides, and the anchor that holds faſt, againſt the greateſt blaſts and billowes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. this intitles us to Gods power and providence, which is like the pillar of a cloud by day, and fire by night, to guide and keep us, as it did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 13.21, 22. and 14.19. This gave courage to the three children.

                     <p>For the firſt to wait on God, is patiently to tarry the Lords leiſure, for the things we deſire, whether it be to be freed from evills, or made partakers of bleſſings, or both; though here the exhortation hath ſpeciall conference to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of deliverance from evills. So that the firſt thing we have here to note is this.</p>
                     <p>That every child of God,<note place="margin">The firſt Obſervation.</note> who is under any evills, of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or mind, or both, muſt ſtirre up his heart to wait the Lords good pleaſure, and leiſure for deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.6. <hi>Let</hi> Iſrael <hi>hope in the Lord,</hi> Luke 21.19. <hi>By your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſſeſſe your ſelves, when you are betrayed, by parents, kinds folks, and friends:</hi> now waiting on God is the holy art, or work of patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25.

                     <p>Firſt, to break off the courſe of every ſin by true repentance, for the guilt of ſinne takes away peace of conſcience, unleſſe it be ſeared: and they, that are in that eſtate and caſe, are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt out mire and dirt, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 57.20. who can rightly wait on God for nothing, but judgements: for while they go on in ſinne, they have no title to mercy, and therefore it is ſaid the hope of the ungodly ſhall periſh, <hi>Prov.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The way to get ſpirituall courage.</note>The way hereto is to make ſure of two things: firſt, that the ſtate of our perſons towards God be good: Secondly. that our godly behaviour expreſſe the ſame. That the ſtate of our perſons may be good before God, three things are required: repentance, faith, and ſanctification. Repentance is that grace of God, whereby we, conſidering our owne wayes in our hearts, do humbly confeſſe our wicked wayes unto God, and praying for mercy and pardon, do forſake the ſinnes wherein we have lived. And this is needfull unto true courage, becauſe the guilt of every ſin brings fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8, 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.66.
<hi>Thou ſhalt feare day and night,</hi> Prov. 28.1. <hi>The wicked flye, when none purſueth: neither ſhall any man ſtrengthen himſelf in the iniquity of his life,</hi> Ezek. 7.13. Faith is that grace of Gods ſpirit, whereby we reſt, and rely on Gods mercy in Chriſts merits, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation: hereby we are juſtified, and be at peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>and the righteous are bold as a Lyon,</hi> Prov. 28.1.

<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, ſanctification is the work of the ſpirit, aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruption, and renewing grace more and more every day. Now they, that are in this eſtate, have the ſpirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them. <hi>Rom.</hi>

                     <p>The godly behaviour needfull to true ſpirituall courage is threefold. Firſt, to make ſure our trouble be for a good cauſe: <hi>for if we ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, we need not be affraid for any terrour,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.14. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as an evill doer — but if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed,</hi> 1 Pet. 4 15, 16.

                     <p>Secondly, the works of his providence, wherein we have had experience of his goodneſſe in former deliverances. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſtrengthened, to encounter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> by the experience of Gods power and providence, in killing the Lyon and the Beare. 1

                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, prayer to God, as well by our ſelves, as by others in our behalf. Thus the Apoſtles ſought courage and boldneſſe, when they were threatned by the rulers of the Jewes,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4.24, 29. and <hi>Paul,</hi> for this end, intreated the
<hi>Epheſians</hi> to pray for him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.19.</p>
                     <p>Gods inward way of ſtrengthening the heart is by the work of his ſpirit: for that is the comforter, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. and the ſpirit of ſtrength, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11.2. of power, and of a ſound mind, 2

                     <p>For our better underſtanding hereof we are to ſearch out, as well the place, as the property, for which <hi>David</hi> doth admire it.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>Here then note two points: one taken for granted, the other purpoſely inteuded. The point taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is, That God hath his Tabernacles or dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he doth in ſpeciall manner abide among his people: ſo as wee may ſay, The Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law he had a materiall building, called the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, erected by
<hi>Moſes</hi> at his appointment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.8. and 40.34.35. which place was movegble, and continued for Gods worſhip, till God had given reſt unto his people round about, and then he cauſed <hi>Solomon</hi> to build him a Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1, 2. Vnder the Goſpell he hath a ſpirituall building, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Ye, as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpirituall houſe, whoſe houſe are we: ſpeaking of all the faithfull, who believe in God through Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. who are the Temple of the living God, in whom he dwels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. whether we conceive them joyntly altogether, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. or divided into particular holy aſſemblies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. or perſonally conſidered, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. and 6.19.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is two-fold: Firſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> the deerer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his eſpeciall favour and reſpect unto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the people of the world: for the whole world is his, and the fulneſſe thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
24.1. yet none can ſay, but the Church of God, who are his people by covenant, that God doth dwell among them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the better aſſuring of all the bleſſing of the Covenant to thoſe that be his people.<note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> For God in Chriſt is the true fountain of all good things: and his dwelling among them, in that manner which he did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in his Tabernacle, gave plain evidence of his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to communicate his goodneſſe unto them, according to all that he had promiſed in his Covenant. This will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98878:86"/>appeare by a briefe view of the ſeverall parts of Gods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, conſidered with the ſpeciall ends for which they were ordained. The whole Tabernacle was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the patterne ſhewed in the mount: It contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned three diſtinct places, <hi>the Court; the holy place, and the holy of holies,</hi> and in each of theſe, there were ſeverall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſerving by their uſe and ſignification to teſtifie Gods readineſſe, who there dwelt among them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his goodneſſe to his people there ſerving him.</p>
                     <p>Take a view of ſome: In the Court (which ſignified the viſible Church, wherein hypocrites may have a place for outward worſhip) was firſt the miniſtry of the word and prayer: Here the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> taught the people, as it is ſaid of Chriſt,
<hi>Luke</hi> 17.47. <hi>he taught dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Temple;</hi> here the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 33.2. and here both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and people prayed, as
<hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. <hi>for my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer,</hi> Luke 19.46. Secondly, here was the altar of burnt-offering, a type of Chriſt: for the altar and the twelve pillars reſembled God and the 12. tribes, making a covenant together with ſacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.4. This altar in the Court of the Tabernacle was overlayed with braſſe a ſtrong metall, to ſignifie that Chriſt God did ſanctifie his manhood to be an acceptable ſacrifice, &amp; ſtrengthen him to do and ſuffer all things needfull for our redemption and ſalvation: Thirdly, the laver for waſhing, a type of ſanctification, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.</p>
                     <p>In the holy place were three memorable things: Firſt, the altar of incenſe, ſhadowing out Chriſts interceſſion in heaven; Secondly, the table of ſhew-bread, ſignifying that ſtanding table of the Word and Sacraments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God keepeth plentifull proviſion to feaſt his elect in Chriſt: Every one had in his incenſe cup pure incenſe put upon it, ſignifying fulneſſe of joy in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>the golden candleſtick,</hi> a figure of the Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20. becauſe it holdeth up the light of Gods
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98878:86"/>Word; The ſeverall branches reſembled particular Churches; and the lights therein ſignified the words of the Prophets, or the holy Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. The ſeven branches from one ſhaft, all of one matter, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied variety of gifts and graces, proceeding from one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.2.6.</p>
                     <p>In the moſt holy place, or holy of holies was firſt the ark, whoſe lidd was called the mercy ſeat, overlaid with pure gold, and within it the two tables of the covenant, all ſhadowing Chriſt, who is our covenant, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49.8. and our propitiatory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1
<hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. Over the ark did God appear between the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> ſignifying God teaching through Chriſt, who is attended by the miniſtry of Angels.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, here were the golden cenſers, to bring fire with incenſe to the mercy-ſeat, ſignifying that with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> incenſe of the ſpirit of Chriſts ſufferings muſt be mingled by Chriſt himſelfe upon the altar with fire, before that our ſervice can be accepted, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.12. with
<hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, here was the

                        </gap>ot of <hi>Mannah,</hi> which God gave them from heaven, ſignifying Chriſt crucified, <hi>the bread that came down from heaven,</hi> Iohn 6.41. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. Alſo

                     <p>Beſides theſe, that did ſeverally belong to ſome of the holy places, there were ſome things common to all. As firſt, the annointing oyle, wherewith every particular veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and inſtrument was conſecrate to his holy uſe, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the graces of the ſpirit, ſanctifying us to God. 2. the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings for the whole tabernacle, ſignifying Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his ſpeciall providence over his whole Church and

<hi>Thou wilt hide me in thy Tabernacle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all theſe, and many other, he both manifeſted his preſence among his people, and alſo his readineſſe to doe them good by communicating ſpirituall bleſſings among them. If any ſay, theſe things proved his preſence amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but what are they to us? I anſwer, much. They were types and ſhadowes of good things to come; but the body is Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. who is come by a more perfect Tabernacle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11. and him we have among us in the word of the Goſpell, fully performing all that was prefigured in legall Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Are our Churches and Chappels anſwerable to the <hi>Iewes</hi> Tabernacle and Temple for prerogative of Gods preſence?</p>

But the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Gods people, aſſembled for holy worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods ordinance, have Chriſt preſent, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20.

<hi>verſ.</hi> 3. This verſe doth naturally branch it ſelf into two parts or propoſitions: whereof the firſt ſhews the happy eſtate; the ſecond, the holy and comfortable behaviour of the true members of Gods Church.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine Houſe.</hi> Gods houſe in <hi>Davids</hi> time, was the place where the Lords Tabernacle was, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.8. unto which, till the Temple was built, God had appropriated his holy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne worſhip, whereof ſee, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.3. But now in the new Teſtament, difference of place in reſpect of holineſſe is taken away, <hi>John</hi> 4.21. and the true Church of God is the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that is, ſuch companies and aſſemblies, as meet together in Chriſts name,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. that is, by warrant and authority from him, and according to his will revealed in his word; worſhip God in the right and reverent uſe of his holy Ordinances, the holy Word and Sacraments ſanctified by prayer, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. To dwell in Gods houſe, is to abide and continue a true member of Gods Church, enjoying the comfort and liberty of Gods holy worſhip and ſervice, either in the place of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or of one of Gods people: for though the Prieſts and the Levites made ſpeciall abode there, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 3.2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134. yet others of the people, who did diligently frequent, and freely enjoy the liberty of Gods worſhip, might be ſaid to dwell therein, elſe <hi>David</hi> would not have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98878:96"/>uſed that phraſe praying for himſelf, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27.4. which I ſay, becauſe ſome Interpreters would limit the firſt branch to the Prieſts and Levites,<note place="margin">Piſcat. Junius.</note> but the 15 <hi>Pſalme</hi> doth enlarge the benefit to all the godly.</p>
                     <p>The thing then to be obſerved in the firſt branch of the verſe is this;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </note> that the true Members of Gods Church, who have the comfort and liberty of Gods holy worſhip and ſervice, are bleſſed and happy. See <hi>Pſal,</hi> 65.4.
<hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt, and cauſest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts.</hi> Hence it followes,
<hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>A day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof is, from the wonderfull, rare, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> which are here certainly enjoyed, by the true Members of the Church, and no where elſe. Whereof the firſt and principall, from which all the reſt do flowe, is the fruition of communion and fellowſhip with the true God, one in eſſence, three in perſon; the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt: who is onely in his Church to the true members thereof a God of grace and mercy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are out of the Church, are without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi>
2.12. Here the firſt perſon, is the father of mercies, and God of all conſolation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. the ſecond perſon is a bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. unto us a childe is born, unto us a Sonne is given, a Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10, 11. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6,
8. the holy Ghoſt is the bleſſed ſanctifier, and comforter, being the ſpirit of grace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. yet onely in his Church, <hi>Joh.</hi>
14.17. Now this true God is in his Church, to all the true members thereof, not onely a Maſter, farre excelling <hi>Solomon,</hi> of whom the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> teſtifies, that his ſervants were bleſſed, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
10.8. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.42. and ſuch a Maſter as ſaith, where I am, thereſhall alſo my ſervant be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. with <hi>Luk.</hi>
12.37, 43, 44. but a father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. Yea, an husband, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. Thy Maker is thine husband, and <hi>Iſa.</hi>
62.4, 5. Thy land ſhall be married.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98878:96"/>As a young man marrieth a Virgin—as the Bridegroome rejoyceth over the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I am married unto you, Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.
<hi>I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed thee unto me for ever, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, this true God in Chriſt gives to all the true members of his Church, freedome and deliverance from all the miſeries of nature; that is, from the whole guilt and curſe of ſinne in originall corruption, and actuall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. See <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.74.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, here is afforded the full fruition of all needfull bleſſings, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. who bleſſeth us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt. And not only ſo, but even with all needfull temporall bleſſings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32, 33. Theſe bleſſings may be reduced to foure heads:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to direction in all the wayes wherein they ought to walke, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.8. <hi>I will inſtruct thee and teach thee in the way that thou ſhalt goe,</hi> Pſal. 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſell.</hi> If the good houſwife order the wayes of her houſhold,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.27. how much more God?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to proviſion both for ſoule and body: for
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>They that ſeeke the Lord ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> for ſoule, <hi>John</hi> 6.33.35.55.63. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10.16. Here is Chriſt the tree of life, and the well of life, whereon
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.7. <hi>All my ſprings are in thee,</hi> Rev. 22.1, 2. And heaven for an inheritance, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. For temporall, ſee <hi>Iſ.</hi> 65.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to protection and preſervation by ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. implyed and aſſured to all the faithfull, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29, 30, 31. The Kings ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in ordinary may not be arreſted but upon warrant from the Lord Chamberlain: but Gods ſervants have a greater priviledge, God himſelf muſt grant the warrant, elſe they may not be medled with, <hi>Job</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, to remuneration, both here with honour of grace to be his friends, <hi>John</hi> 15.14, 15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98878:97"/>attendance of Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

                     <p>Is it ſuch a bleſſing to dwell in Gods houſe? then it is a great curſe to dwell out of it: <label type="milestone">

<hi>If they be the children of men, curſed be they before the Lord: for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Goe, ſerve other Gods.

                     <p>For the firſt: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee]</hi> To bee bleſſed is to be in an happy eſtate, wherein a man enjoyeth the true and chiefeſt good, which is the true God in his ſpeciall favour, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. But who do ſo?</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98878:99"/>which the Lord requireth at his hands.

<hi>Proverbs</hi> 16.20. <hi>who ſo truſteth in the Lord is happy,</hi> and

                     <p>Firſt, that we ſtand rightly in covenant with God, having avouched him for our God, not onely by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſeales of the covenant, in being baptized and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Lords Table, which Hypocrites may do, but eſpecially by reverend receiving the word of the covenant, and humbly ſubmitting our ſelves thereto, as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when he avouched Iſrael to be his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. and they performed, when they ſate down at his feet, every one receiving his word, <hi>Deut.</hi>
33.3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt ſee that our hearts be endued with true faith, whereby we truſt in God unfeignedly, reſting and relying upon his promiſe for all the bleſſings of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. This grace entitles us to have God for our ſhield. Prov. 30.5. <hi>Every word of God is pure, he is a ſhield to thoſe that truſt in him.</hi> Pſal. 18.30. <hi>The word of the Lord is tried, he is a buckler to thoſe that truſt in him.</hi> Pſal. 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him, and I am helped:</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18, 19. 20.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we muſt walk uprightly before him, making conſcience of all ſinne, and leading a godly life. This God required of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom he promiſed to become a ſhield, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17.1. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. and <hi>Solomon</hi> gives aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly,</hi> that is, to thoſe that look in all things to pleaſe God, and lean neither to this ſinne nor that. And to move us hereunto, let us conſider the evils of the times in the abundance of iniquity, which cry to heaven for moſt heavie judgements: let us think upon the troubles of other nations, and our own preſent danger ſundry wayes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from diviſions both in Church and ſtate. Now in times of trouble, nothing can be better for us, then to have the Lord for our ſhield, for then we need not fear, what can man do unto us? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.6.</p>

Conſider <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, 2. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I feare, &amp;c,</hi> Jer. 20.11. <hi>The Lord is with me like a mighty terrible one, therefore all mine enemies ſhall be confounded, but I ſhall not be confounded.</hi> This made <hi>David</hi> not to feare ten thouſand of the people that ſhould beſet him round about,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.6. nor walking through the ſhadow of death,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. This made the three ſervants of the Lord not fear the hot fiery furnace, nor the fierceneſſe of the King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now conſider that God is without ſhadow of change.
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. and he was a ſhield to <hi>Abraham, David, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> and others; let us therefore labour to be like them, and we may with like confidence reſt aſſured of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as the Lord promiſed, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 9.4, 5. and as the godly do comfortably expect, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22.4, 5.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing to be noted here, is the favour which he begs and craves of God, namely,<note place="margin">2
<hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </note> that God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and look upon his face, that is, look upon him favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, taking gracious notice of his eſtate and deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4. <hi>looke upon my right hand and ſee,</hi> ſo the words are in the originall as the marginall reading hath it,

Yet withall we muſt know, that <hi>David</hi> ſtiles himſelf Gods anointed, with ſpeciall reference to that high favour and honour whereto God had advanced him. when he anointed him by <hi>Samuel,</hi> to be King over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12.

<hi>in the ſenſe before ſhewed, God hath been wrath and fiercely angry with his own people. When God heard this, he was wrath, and greatly abhorred</hi> Iſrael: <hi>He was wrath with his inheritance,</hi> Pſal.
78.59, 62. <hi>The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt his people: inſomuch, that he abhorred his own inheritance.</hi> Pſal. 106.40.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>The reaſon hereof is the ſinnes of his people, which many times are many and grievous, ſuch as the holy nature of God cannot but deteſt, and in divine juſtice ſeverely puniſh. For ſinne is the provocation. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.13.
<hi>For great is the wrath of the Lord, which is kindled againſt us, becauſe our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this booke.</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>hath grievouſly ſinned: therefore ſhee is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Lam. 1.8. <hi>And, we have tranſgreſſed, and rebelled, thou haſt not pardoned.

5, 6.</p>
                     <p>This fourth verſe contains two requeſts: Firſt, that God would turn them: Secondly, that he would cauſe his anger toward them to ceaſe: Both which bleſſings they beg of the true God, whom they call the God of their ſalvation, that is, the God who ſaves and delivers them from the evills and miſeries that lye upon them.</p>

They pray to God, whom they call the God of their ſalvation: and therein we have two things to be obſerved: Firſt, what God is to his Church, namely, the God of their ſalvation.

                     <p>Firſt, that we become the children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for to ſuch ſalvation comes. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.9. Now, ſuch may be known by doing the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> John 8.39. He is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. who by faith, firſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his own people, and his fathers houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, 9. compared with
<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 4. ſecondly, commanded his houſhold to ſerve God.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. thirdly, made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to God for the ſparing of <hi>Sodom,</hi> no doubt for the elects ſake, that he hoped had been therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.23. &amp;c. fourthly, by faith offered his own ſonne, yea his only ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for an offering upon Gods command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.1. &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 17. In all theſe we muſt labour to ſhew our ſelves to be the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Conſider all, and look eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the mortification of corruption, the ſinnes of our hearts and ſoules. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Gal.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, the true God is a ſaviour unto every one, that is a true member of Chriſts body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. Now, true members are joyned to their head, by the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and by vertue thereof receive life and ſenſe from Chriſt ſpiritually, as

It is true, in temporall evills, man by nature hath ſome ability, to diſcern and endeavour the way and means of his deliverance: but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98878:134"/>in ſpirituall evills, of corruption and ſinne, it is not ſo: for therein man naturally is dead, and ſo wants abilitie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conceive and act the things that belong to the life of grace, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9.

                     <p>The long continuance of his anger is twiſe propounded,
<hi>verſe</hi> 5. to expreſſe their deeper ſenſe thereof, &amp; their more earneſt deſire to have it removed. The delay of his favour is lamented, in the ſixt <hi>verſe,</hi> and there amplified by the good effect of his renewing thereof, namely, their rejoycing in him.</p>

<hi>O God, why haſt thou caſt us off for ever? why doth thine anger ſmoak againſt the ſheep of thy paſture.</hi> Verſe 10. <hi>O God, how long ſhall the adverſacy reproach? ſhall the enemy blaſpheme thy name for ever?</hi> Pſalm 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercie cleane gone for ever? doth his promiſe faile for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in

Pſal.</hi> 79.5. <hi>How long, Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever? ſhall thy jealouſie burne like fire?</hi> Lament. 5.20, 22. <hi>Wherefore doeſt thou forget us for ever, and forſake us ſo long time.

<hi>David</hi> ſhewed in his flight from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> when hee bade

But, if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold here I am, let him do to me, as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Secondly, they more deſire the feeling of Gods favour, then the removall of the affliction: as
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. after <hi>Nathan</hi> had told <hi>David, The Lord hath put away thy ſinne, thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98878:141"/>ſhalt not dye.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
12.13. yet, he prayes the Lord to make him to heare joy and gladneſſe: and,
<hi>verſe</hi> 12. to reſtore him to the joy of his ſalvation. Now, naturall men in theſe caſes deale otherwiſe: Firſt, they look more at the outward miſery, then at Gods diſpleaſure: as <hi>Iſ.</hi> 26.11.
<hi>when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee,</hi> Pſal. 10.5. <hi>Thy judgements are farre above out of his ſight.</hi> Secondly, they more deſire the removall of Gods judgements, then the renewing of of his favour: and therefore are ſaid, <hi>not to cry to the Lord with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds.

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.13. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoule from death, wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling?</hi> 2. Feare God in heart, and ſhew it by eſchewing evill, and doing good in life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12, 14.

<hi>What ſhould I wait upon the Lord any longer?</hi> They deal with their prayers, as the Oftrich doth with her eggs, which ſhe leaveth in the earth, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 39.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe God hath deprived them of uunderſtanding, as puniſhment of their contempt of the meanes of grace, elſe they would not account the exerciſe of prayer unprofitable: as,

                        <note place="margin">The uſe for admonition.</note>For admonition, that we endeavour to approve our ſelves to be Gods people, by waiting upon God for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer to our prayers. This we ſhould do every day, according to the practiſe of the Church in this place: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if we did indeed ſet our ſelves, we would make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of all ſinne, that we might keep our ſelves in the love of God, without which we cannot comfortably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a gracious anſwer from him to our prayers. Now to enable us to wait and liſten for a gracious anſwer, when we have prayed, we muſt be well exerciſed in godly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practiſe.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration needfull hereto is three fold Firſt, of Gods promiſe made to thoſe that pray unto him: for it is preſumption to wait for that, which God hath not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give: True expectation is a fruit of faith, which ever looks at Gods word of promiſe. Secondly, of Gods power and mercy: for as his power will aſſure us, that he is able, ſo his mercie will ſhew, that he is moſt ready and willing to grant our requeſts. Thirdly, we muſt conſider his manner of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98878:149"/>anſwer: it is three-fold. Sometime, by giving that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bleſſing we ask: as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.27. <hi>For this childe I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my Petition, which I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him.</hi> Sometime, by giving ſome other thing anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the bleſſing: as, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> And ſometimes by giving patience and ſtrength to bear the evils which we would have removed; as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</p>
                     <p>The godly practiſe hereto needfull, is threefold. Firſt, to ſtir up our hearts to lay hold on Gods promiſes by faith: as,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. And herein we muſt ſhew godly judgement, in labouring to truſt perfectly for ſpirituall bleſſings, ſimply needfull to ſalvation: as, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have believed, &amp;c.</hi> But for ſpirituall bleſſings leſſe neceſſary, as alſo for all temporall bleſſings, to ſubmit our wils to Gods will. Secondly, we muſt hold on in the way of obedience.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.34. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he ſhall exalt thee to inherit the land.</hi> Thirdly, continue in prayer. <hi>Col.</hi>

                     <p>In this reaſon we have two things to note. Firſt, the honourable title whereby Gods people here be ſtiled; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are his Saints.

<hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. but undoubtedly, there is fruit for the righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.11. <hi>Godlineſſe is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.6. <hi>It is profitable unto all things, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.

                     <p>Secondly, by true faith in Chriſt reſt and rely upon Gods mercy, for pardon of ſinne and ſalvation: for he, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto God, and hath fellowſhip with him, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. therefore Chriſt bidding his Diſciples to believe on him, as they believe on God, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. doth encourage them thereto by this, that he is the way, the truth, and the life, by whom alone they muſt have acceſſe to the father. <hi>verſe</hi> 6.

And hereto two things are required; firſt, that we know the true Church; and ſecondly, that we be not only in it, but of it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt; where the true Church of God is, what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98878:182"/>people, profeſſing religion, be Gods true Church is a great queſtion, of large extent, and much diſputed between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Papiſts. For our direction and reſolution brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let us learn this. That the true Church is Chriſts myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. Gave him (that is Chriſt) to be the head over all things, to the Church, which is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. That ſpirituall building which conſiſt of ſpirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtones, built upon the foundation Ieſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. That is, ſuch profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the the faith of the Goſpell, as by the work of the ſpirit are indued with true faith, and adorn their profeſſion with new obedience. Now then, thoſe that profeſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt, through the work of the ſpirit in grace, undoubtedly are true members of Chriſts Church. But thoſe, that be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced to want fellowſhip with Chriſt through faith, are no Church of God, nor true members thereof. Now they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are cut off from this fellowſhip by their ido atry, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe things, which he hath not ſeen, vainly puft up by his fleſhly mind and not holding the head, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By their opinion of juſtification by works. Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. By making the Pope the head of the Church; for he is Antichriſt, and thoſe that ſo hold are Antichriſtian; the true Church hath not two heads.</p>
                     <p>The way to become true members of Chriſts Church, for ſure title to Gods ſpeciall love, is humbly and reverently to receive the word of the covenant, and conſcionably to yeeld obedience thereunto: as,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.26. The right receiving is by faith, 1 Pet. 2.7. And the truth thereof muſt be teſtified by obedience. <hi>For true faith wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by love,</hi> Gal. 5, 6. <hi>And this is the love of God, that wet keep his Commandements,</hi> 1 Iohn 5.3.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond uſe for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note>Secondly, the wicked of the world muſt hereby be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98878:183"/>to beware of wronging Gods children; for God, that loves them above others, will require and requite it,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.14, 15. <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea he reproved Kings for their ſakes:</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harme; He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> Zech. 2.8. Therefore it will be good to regard, and follow the counſell of <hi>Gamaliel, Acts</hi> 5.38.
<hi>Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone; leſt we be found fighters againſt God, and it be ſaid to us, as it was unto</hi> Paul, Acts 9.4, 5.
<hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For conſolation, it makes greatly to every true member of Gods Church, in any diſtreſſe: for certainly they have a ſpeciall part and portion in Gods love; from which no afflictions can ſeparate them, ſee
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35,37,38,39. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, or ſword? Nay, in all theſe things we are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, through him that loved us, &amp;c.

Therefore, even in affliction, they may ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not againſt me, O mine enemie, when I fall, I ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, when I ſit in darkneſſe, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me,</hi> Micah 7.8.</p>

                     <p>For the better conceiving whereof, we muſt ſearch out two things: Firſt, the countries, or people here ſpoken of: Secondly, how their calling or converſion to the Church is expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The Countries here named, by which we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the people inhabiting them, are in a double rank: Firſt, Rahab and Babylon. By Rahab we muſt underſtand not the harlot <hi>Rahab,</hi> that received the Spies, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2. as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancient Fathers do, <hi>viz. Jerome, Auſtin, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Euthymius, Caſſiodorus,</hi> and others. For firſt, her name in the originall, is written with a <hi>denſe aſpirate</hi>

                        </gap>. Secondly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned names do ſhew, that by Rahab here is meant a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or people, rather then one particular perſon: whereby we may ſee how injurious and prejudicall to truth it is, to make the unanimous or generall conſent of Fathers, the

                     <p>But by Rahab wee muſt here underſtand Egypt, as in many other places it is certainly taken. <hi>Thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Rahab in pieces, as one that is ſlain.</hi> Pſal. 89.10. <hi>Art thou it, that hath cut Rabab, and wounded the dragon? Iſa.</hi> 51.9. Where Rahab is Egypt, and the dragor is <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King thereof, as the Verſe following doth plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>
                     <p>Why Egypt is called Rahab, is very probable from ſome City ſo called; or rather, as I conceive, from her conceited ſtrength, wherein ſhe did pride her ſelf: whereto, ſome think, alluſion is made

                     <p>Babylon is the chief City of Aſſyria, as <hi>Gen.</hi>

The ordinance is the holy Goſpell preached, That the Gentiles ſhould be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heires, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Chriſt, by the Goſpell, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6.

I declare unto you the Goſpell, which I preached unto you, which alſo ye have received, and wherein ye ſtand: By which alſo ye are ſaved, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14.1, 2. This Goſpell preached is the word of

                     <p>The right manner, wherein we muſt wait in the foreſaid ordinance, for the bleſſed work of the ſpirit, in an holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is this: Firſt, by the law to ſee our miſerable eſtate by nature, which will ſtirre up the ſoule to ſeek mercy, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we doe;</hi> and to break off the courſe of ſinne, whereon is promiſed the gift of the ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my reproofe, behold, I will porore out my ſpirit unto you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, to hunger and thirſt after the work of the ſpirit, as the dry ground doth after rain, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.6. <hi>I ſtretch forth my hands unto thee: my ſoule thirſteth after thee as a thirſty land.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation.</note>The third thing to be noted here is, that ſpeciall ſtate, which declares any man, of any nation, to be a free Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods City, and a true member of his Church, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be born there: yet not by naturall generation, but, by ſpirituall regeneration: whereof Chriſt ſpeaking ſaith, <hi>they muſt be born again, or from above,</hi> John3.3. <hi>borne of water, and of the holy Ghost,</hi> John3.5. <hi>Not of fleſh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God:</hi> Joh. 1.13.</p>
                     <p>Mark here, then, that, <hi>To be born again,</hi> declares any man, of any nation, <hi>to be a free Deniſon of Gods holy City, and a true member of his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is plain by the former place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, 6. to all thoſe, that underſtand the nature and force of an exception to a generall rule, which is, to put the contrary to the rule. It is indeed a true rule in Scripture, That Gods Church is Gods kingdome, into which man in the corrupt ſtate of nature cannot enter, as heir to inherit. Fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God: neither doth corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption inherit incorruption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. But yet, if ſuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98878:190"/>a one be born again, he doth certainly enter, as heyr, and ſhall inherit: as, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again, unto a lively hope by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Christ from the dead, To an inheritance incorruptible, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Mark alſo, that true faith and regeneration do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany each other. Whoſoever beleeveth, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. Now, true believers are children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. For, ye are all the children of God. by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo free, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.26. they are heyres, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. and have great prerogatives implyed, <hi>John</hi> 1.12, 13. expreſſed

                        <note place="margin">The Reaſon.</note>The reaſon hereof is plain: for this change of ſtate in ſoul, by regeneration, is the proper fruit of the ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, in an affectuall applying of the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſts death and reſurrection: both which proceed from the ſpeciall love of God the father, in that ſaving work, which actually makes them his children, and ſo heyrs of the kingdome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. joynt heires with Chriſt: and ſo free, for the children are free, <hi>Matth.</hi>

                     <p>For the better underſtanding whereof we muſt know, that the Prophet doth here ſpeak of God, after the manner of great perſonages, who uſe to write, and enrowle in a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98878:197"/>book, the names of thoſe, that they accept and receive into their houſes and families, as members thereof, to any place of ſervice; for which ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.20. <hi>Pharoah,</hi> on his birth day, making a feaſt unto all his ſervants, lifted up the head of his chief butler, and of his chief baker, among his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that is, taking a view of all his ſervants, according to their names, written in his book, (as the ſame phraſe is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.49. there tranſlated, taking the ſum, which in <hi>Geneſis</hi> is rendred,
<hi>lifting up the head</hi>) he reckoned his chief butler, and chief baker, among his ſervants. In like manner, the ſcripture calleth the Church
<hi>the houſe of the living God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and for our better conceiving of his certain, and perfect knowledge, &amp; remembrance, both of all things, that ever were, are, or ſhall be in the world, and alſo of all thoſe perſons, that in a ſpeciall manner belong unto him, as true members of his Church on earth, whom he means to glorifie in heaven, doth tell us of certain books, which God hath, even three in number, which we may not uafitly thus diſtinguiſh by name. Firſt, the book of his eternall preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Pſal</hi> 139.16. <hi>Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members are written, which in continuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> This is nothing elſe, but his perfect eternall foreſight of all things, before they were, whereby he knew them, as perfectly, as if they had been actually written in a book.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the book of his actuall providence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth moſt perfectly take actuall knowledge of, and remember all things whatſoever, even every thought, word, and deed, of every man. Hereof ſee
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1, 2,3. O Lord thou haſt ſearched me, and known me; Thou knoweſt my down ſitting, and mine upriſing, thou underſtandeſt my thought a farre off, &amp;c, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.8. Thou telleſt my wanderings, put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? and according to this he will judge the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. I ſaw the dead both ſmall and great ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and the books were opened, and another book
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98878:197"/>
                        <hi>was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of thoſe things, which were written in the books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is the book of life, which is Gods eternall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the ſaving of his elect by Chriſt actually declared by their effectuall calling, or regeneration, by the holy ghoſt, in this life, in which eſtate they are referved and kept for glory.</p>
                     <p>This book may be ſaid to betwice written in. Firſt, from all eternity in Gods purpoſe, whereof ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. whoſe names are not written, in the book of life of the Lamb, ſlain from the foundation of the world. Secondly, actually in Gods work of effectuall calling, or regeneration, in the time of naturall life, which is termed <hi>Gods calling according to purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. And indeed, of this latter writing in the book of life, by regeneration or effectuall calling, is this place to be underſtood. As if he ſhould have ſaid, That the Church hath great honour, and the true members of it great happineſſe, is hereby apparent, that when God writes up the people actually in the book of life, that be is, he reckons thoſe for his, that be regenerate, and born again in his Church.</p>
                     <p>In the words thus underſtood note two things; Firſt, Gods work of ſpeciall mercy to the true members of the Church: Secondly, the quality and condition of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom the foreſaid work of mercy is certainly vouchſafed.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note>For the firſt, Gods ſpeciall work of mercy, to the true members of the Church, is this, <hi>he actually writes their names in the book of life,</hi> and then reckons and accounts them to be his own. This is plainly ſhewed in his golden chain, Rom. 8.29, 40, <hi>Whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the image of his ſon, that he might be the firſt born, among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them hee alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>

                     <p>Vpon this effectuall calling he bids his Diſciples rejoyce, that their names were written in heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. and upon the good effects and ſigns of effectuall calling, he ſaith of certain teachers, that were zealous of Gods glory, in the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> that their names were in the book of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon hereof may be two wayes confidered.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſecond obſervation.</note>The ſecond point to be noted is, the quality and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe parties, whom God writes with his people in the book of life, and ſo reckons for his own; They are borne there, that is, born again by regeneration in the true Church. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4.
